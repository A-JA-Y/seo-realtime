# Implementation notes — deliberate deviations from the build prompt

Every item here is a place where following the prompt literally would have
produced a bug or a deploy failure. Each says what changed and why.

---

## 1. `gsc_snapshots` unique constraint uses `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`

**Prompt (§4):**

```sql
UNIQUE (keyword_id, gsc_date, gsc_hour, data_state)
```

**Problem.** In Postgres, `NULL` values in a unique constraint are *distinct*
from one another by default. `gsc_hour` is `NULL` on every `fresh` and `final`
row (§5 says reconciliation writes `gsc_hour = NULL`). So for daily rows the
constraint can never fire: `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` never triggers, and running
`reconcile-gsc` twice writes two rows instead of updating one.

That breaks domain rule 9 ("every ingest is idempotent") and acceptance
criterion 2 ("running `ingest-gsc` twice in a row produces identical row
counts") — silently, with no error.

**Change.** The constraint is emitted as:

```sql
UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (keyword_id, gsc_date, gsc_hour, data_state)
```

Postgres 15+ syntax; Neon runs 17. Two `NULL` hours now collide as intended.
The alternative — a sentinel hour such as `-1` for daily rows — was rejected
because it repeats the mistake domain rule 5 warns about.

## 2. `bcryptjs` instead of native `bcrypt`

Same algorithm, same cost factor (12), same `$2a$`/`$2b$` output format.
Native `bcrypt` needs a node-gyp compile that fails on Vercel's build image and
inflates the serverless bundle. Cost 12 as specified.

## 3. One Vercel cron slot, chaining three daily jobs

The prompt's §7 table lists three daily jobs (`reconcile-gsc` 04:00,
`rollup` 04:30, `prune` 05:00). Vercel Hobby's cron allowance is small and has
varied between 1 and 2 jobs per project across plan revisions; acceptance
criterion 11 requires the deploy to succeed on Hobby.

`vercel.json` therefore registers exactly **one** daily cron,
`/api/cron/daily`, which runs `reconcile-gsc` → `rollup` → `prune` in sequence
and records an `ingest_runs` row per step. Each step remains individually
addressable (`/api/cron/rollup` etc.) for the external scheduler and for manual
re-runs. This is Hobby-safe under any of the published limits.

## 4. `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` newline unescaping happens in `src/lib/env.ts`

§5's snippet shows `.replace(/\\n/g, '\n')` at the call site in `gscClient()`.
Doing it in the Zod schema instead means the key is normalised exactly once,
at the single boundary where env is read, and no future caller can forget it.
The transform is idempotent, so an already-unescaped key passes through
unchanged.

## 5. `drizzle.config.ts` reads `process.env` directly

§2 says "never read `process.env` anywhere else in the codebase." drizzle-kit
runs as a standalone CLI outside the Next.js runtime; importing `src/lib/env.ts`
there would pull the app's module graph into the migration tool and require
every runtime secret to be present just to generate SQL. The config file reads
the two database URLs directly and is the only exception. `src/lib/env.ts`
itself also reads `process.env` — that is the point of it.

## 6. Recharts 3.x

`recharts@2` is published as deprecated on npm. 3.x is current and keeps the
`reversed` / `connectNulls` APIs that §11's chart requirements depend on.

## 7. The database handle falls back to node-postgres off Neon

§2 specifies the Neon serverless driver, and that is what production uses:
`src/server/db/index.ts` picks it whenever `DATABASE_URL` points at a
`*.neon.tech` host, which in production it always does.

Any other host falls back to `node-postgres`. The reason is testability. §13
requires integration tests covering idempotent ingest, reconciliation and
cross-tenant isolation, and the Neon HTTP driver can only talk to Neon — so
without this, none of those tests can run in CI, in a pre-commit hook, or on a
machine without a Neon account. With it, `TEST_DATABASE_URL` can point at a Neon
`dev` branch or at a throwaway local Postgres, and the suite exercises the real
query builder either way.

`pg` is a devDependency, so it is not installed in the production bundle. The
branch that would load it cannot be reached there.

The handle is typed as `NeonHttpDatabase` rather than as a union of the two.
A union collapses the `.returning()` overloads and breaks typing at every call
site; declaring the Neon type is also the conservative choice, because it
advertises no interactive transactions — the constraint production actually
runs under.

## 8. Environment validation is deferred to first access, not module load

§2 says to validate `process.env` "once at startup". `src/lib/env.ts` still
validates once and caches, but the parse is triggered by the first property
read rather than by module evaluation.

The reason is the setup flow this repo is supposed to support. `requirements.md`
walks through Google, then DataForSEO, then Neon, then Vercel, then Auth.js, and
each stage ends in a verification command. With eager whole-environment
validation, `pnpm verify:gsc` would fail on a missing `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`
before it ever reached Google — making the guide impossible to follow in the
order it is written. The verify scripts call `requireEnv(...)` for the narrow
slice they need.

For the application itself nothing changes in practice: the first access
happens while a server module initialises, so a bad environment still fails
immediately and loudly.
